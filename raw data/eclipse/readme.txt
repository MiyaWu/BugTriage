The zip file of buglist contains the list of all the 200,000 records of Eclipse bug reports.

Due to the space limit by GitHub, we splitted the file of bughistory into five parts. Each file in the five zip files records the modified history of the corresponding bug report. The final fixer of a given bug report can be identified in the corresponding csv file.

Due to the same reason mentioned above, we also splitted the file of bugdescription into fen parts. Each file in the ten zip files contains the description and comment of the corresponding bug report.
